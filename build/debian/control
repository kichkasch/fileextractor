Description: File Recovery Tool written in Python
 FileExtractor is a free (open source) tool for recovering files from a binary data source. Sources such as digital cameras, 
 partitions, harddrives, memory sticks or floppy disks may be corrupted, deleted or formatted by mistake. 
 Once the file system is destroyed you need a tool such as FileExtractor to recover your files.
