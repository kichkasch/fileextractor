1. Introduction
---------------
Enables users to image devices or partitions. This way, you may image a harddisk partition,
a memory stick, the memory of your digital camera, a CD you overwrote, a ZIP disk and 
the like. In fact, whenever you have a driver and have been able to access the device before
it turned corrupted or you deleted for formated you should be able to image.

2. Mode of operation
--------------------
Basically, the OS system commands dd are utilised. The system call is performed and some
observations for file size and so on are done. Finally, it's more or less not much more than a
python based front end for the dd command; but it's working :)

3. ToDo
-------
* Preselect core (if os.name == 'posix'  ...... if sys.platform[:3] == 'win'
* All Cores 
    - Few functions seem to be the same for all OSs ... consider moving to abstract class
* ImageGenerator (Graphical Interface)
* CLI
    - process command line arguments in order to avoid user input
    - delete file for buffering output
* Error Handling
    - source file available
    - not sufficient permissions for destination file
* Linux Core
    - ???
* Default values for source and destination must be moved from Runtime module to core 
    implementation modules
* Revise the importing of core implementation - not really nice at the end of the CoreManager - into the abstract?
* check for user name - program must run as "root" - sufficient privileges to directly access the device

4. Known Bugs
-------------
* Crash if source {file / device} not available
* Check spaces in input files / output files
* End of CDs not recognised (seen in Linux)
