1. Requirements 
---------------

Before you start the installation of the program, please make sure that your system hits the following requirements: 


Operating System

Since the program was written in Python it is cross-plattform; hence, you can you it whenever a Python 
version is available for your Operating System. (Please make also sure that the Python Extension (next Paragraph) 
are available). However, the program was tested sucessfully on the following installations:

- Linux Kernel 2.6.5 (Gentoo Linux 2005.0 with Python 2.3.4)
- Windows XP (with SP 1 and Python 2.4.1 or Python 2.4.0)

Please tell me if it is running on your plattform which is different and I am going to extent this list.


Python and its modules

Make also sure that you have installed Python with the following modules:

- Python (tested with Python 2.3.4 / 2.4 / 2.4.1 - but should also be running with lower versions.) www.python.org
- For the GUI part: wxPython (with all its dependencies) - wxpython.org You may also download binaries from this link.


2. Unpack the program files and start the application 
-----------------------------------------------------

You may place the files to a location of your choice. The following locations are suggestions only: 


Windows XP/2000

- Take the program Archive file and extract its content to C:\Program Files (assuming your Windows Drive is C:)
  Automatically, a subdirecty (FileExtractor) will be created and all required files will be stored in there.
- Create a short cut to your desktop. Close (or minimise) all running programs and right-click your Desktop; 
  choose New / Shortcut from the context menu. For location put the directory from the previous step together 
  with the program file (C:\Program Files\FileExtractor\FileExtractor.py) Choose a reasonable name for the 
  new shortcut (such as FileExtractor).
Assuming, you have a running python installation and your configuration includes Python files (.py) being linked 
with the Python Interpreter, the program may be started just by double-clicking the before created shortcut. 


Linux / Unix
 
- Extract the content of the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.
- Browse into this folder and edit the program file FileExtractor.py. The first line contains an entry for the 
  environment variable for the python program file. Check, whether this is set for you system and is corretly 
  pointing to your python executable. 
- If not yet done, change the permissions of the program file (FileExtractor.py) to executable for user. 
  (chmod u+x FileExtractor.py)

You may run the program just by calling the program file FileExtractor.py 


3. Command Line Interface (CLI)
-------------------------------

FileExtractor is also coming with a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you are unable or not willing to install 
wxPython you may run this version instead. Check the help (FileExtractorCLI --help) for more information.
